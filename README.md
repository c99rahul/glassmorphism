## Overview

All these examples focus on the basics of Glassmorphism, providing UI implementations using both vanilla CSS and Tailwind CSS.

### Contents

- Refer to [this Figma file](//www.figma.com/file/IukVe5sA8vnRu9RwF196ym/Glassmorphism?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=VOSJhWqsQVJfGzeK-1) to learn how to create a basic Glassmorphism UI effect in Figma
- Check out the [CSS examples](css-examples/) to understand the essentials of Glassmorphism UI created with vanilla CSS
- Find Tailwind CSS implementations in [this dedicated section](twcss-examples/)

## Usage & Prerequisites

This project uses [images from Unsplash](//unsplash.com) and [Google Fonts](//fonts.google.com) for presentational purposes, and it also makes use of [the Tailwind CSS CDN](//tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn) when necessary. This simplifies the process after cloning the repository, as you won't need to set up images, fonts, or Tailwind CSS separately.

You won't need to install extra packages or front-end frameworks for this project. A basic understanding of CSS and familiarity with Tailwind CSS basics are sufficient.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the examples to enhance your understanding of Glassmorphism in UI design. If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to [the tutorial guide](//blog.logrocket.com/implement-glassmorphism-css/) or raise an issue in the repository.

_Happy coding!_
