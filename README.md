## Overview

All these examples focus on the basics of Glassmorphism, providing UI implementations using both vanilla CSS and Tailwind CSS. 

### Contents

- Refer to [this Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/IukVe5sA8vnRu9RwF196ym/Glassmorphism?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=VOSJhWqsQVJfGzeK-1) to learn how to create a basic Glassmorphism UI effect in Figma
- Check out the [CSS examples](css-examples/) to understand the essentials of Glassmorphism UI created with vanilla CSS
- Find Tailwind CSS implementations in [this dedicated section](twcss-examples/)

## Usage & Prerequisites

This project uses images from Unsplash and makes use of the Tailwind CSS CDN when necessary. This makes it easy after you clone this repository, as you won't have to set up images or Tailwind CSS separately.

You won't need to install extra packages or front-end frameworks for this project. A basic understanding of CSS and familiarity with Tailwind CSS basics are sufficient.
